    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g noodles or vermicelli (preferably whole wheat for added nutrients)</li>
        <li>1 liter of milk (you can use whole milk for a richer taste or plant-based milk for a vegan option)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar (this adds a caramelized note)</li>
        <li>1 packet vanilla sugar (for an enticing aroma)</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons cinnamon (to taste)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional, but recommended)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon almond extract (for a sophisticated flavor)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon extract (to balance the sweetness)</li>
        <li>Zest of one orange (for an extra freshness)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Prepare the ingredients: Make sure all ingredients are at hand. The noodles can be broken into smaller pieces for better integration into the mixture.</li>
        <li>Boil the milk: Take a large pot and place the milk over medium heat. Add the brown sugar and vanilla sugar, stirring gently to dissolve.</li>

        <li>Incorporate the noodles: Add the broken noodles to the hot milk. Stir well and let simmer on low heat for 10-12 minutes, or until the noodles are fully cooked and have absorbed most of the milk.</li>
        <li>Add the orange zest: In the last minutes of cooking, add the orange zest to intensify the flavor of the dessert.</li>
        <li>Serving: Once the dessert is ready, you can choose to serve it warm or cold, depending on your preferences. It can be garnished with a sprinkle of cinnamon or chopped nuts for added texture.</li>
