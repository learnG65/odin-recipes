    <h2>Description</h2> 
    <p>Picture yourself inside a woodern house, a great fireplace and the smell of sweet plums drifting through the air. Whilst the housing is not provided, the recipe is more than enough to make up for it</p> 

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the dumplings:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg potatoes</li>
        <li>2 chicken eggs</li>
        <li>500 g flour (+/- 50 g)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons semolina</li>
        <li>1 cube of butter</li>
        <li>1 pinch of nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons powdered sugar</li>
        <li>15-20 plums</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For coating:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200 g ground walnuts</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>100 g brown sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Additional:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Water + 1 pinch of salt, for boiling</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean and wash the potatoes and put them to boil. You can wash them and boil them with the skin on. I clean them and steam them for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>After they are cooked, mash them with a fork, add the butter, semolina, and beaten eggs, and mix quickly until homogeneous. Add the powdered sugar mixed with nutmeg, and the flour. Mix well, then let the dough cool.</li>
        <li>Wash and cut the plums in half. If they are small, you can remove the pits and use them whole.</li>
        <li>Toast the walnuts a bit and grind them finely. In a bowl, mix the ground walnuts, breadcrumbs, cinnamon, and brown sugar.</li>
        <li>Use a well-floured, well-floured surface. Form balls from the dough, press a whole plum or half in the middle, and form a compact ball. Set them aside on a wooden cutting board.</li>
        <li>Put a large pot on the stove with water and a pinch of salt. Let it boil and add 5-6 dumplings to the water and let them cook. When they rise to the surface, let them boil for another 4-5 minutes, then remove them with a slotted spoon.</li>
        <li>Immediately roll them in the walnut mixture. Arrange them on a platter and keep at room temperature until serving.</li>
    </ol>
